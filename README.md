# 2FA Android-App

This App generates 2FA-Codes using Time based One-Time Passewords (TOTP) according to RFC 6238.
It can read QR-Codes using the Google-Authenticator [URI-Format](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator/wiki/Key-Uri-Format)
and stores the accounts using an SQLite database.

Accounts using HOTPs are **not** supported.

## Language
The UI is in German only
